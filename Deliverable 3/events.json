    "description": "\"Round 1 of the 2021 Beginners' Client Interviewing Competition is here! Registration is available for all undergraduate, and postgraduate law students in their first year of study, or students who have transferred into their first year of law. We encourage all of the students within this group to sign up if they are interested in developing their skills in empathy, critical problem-solving and communication. Participants will be provided with the opportunity to engage with fascinating, and often hilarious problem scenarios in the Competition in order to come to understand, and assist fictitious clients with the various issues they face in their lives. This is an absolutely unmissable opportunity, and we promise that you will not regret signing up! \n\n\nPlease note that it does not matter if you did not participate in the Practice Round held in Weeks 5-6; you can sign up individually or with a partner. In order to participate in future rounds of the Competition, you will need to register for Round 1. In addition, to compete, all teams will need to nominate 1 client. They do not need to be a UNSW or Law student to participate!\n\n\nIf you are a second-year or beyond, and you have participated in Client Interviewing before, we strongly urge you to sign up as a judge! You will receive the opportunity to become AHEGS accredited, and will learn invaluable skills through your assessment of competitors throughout the course of the Competition. \n\n\nAny questions can be answered by the Beginners' Client Interviewing Co-Directors, Jess Cassimaty and Leilani Hunt. We can be contacted at beginners.clientinterviewing@unswlawsoc.org.au. We hope to see as many of you sign up as possible!

By bringing all the major sponsors together to advertise their respective recruitment programs, students are given the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of private law in practice!\n\nIn light of COVID-19 restrictions, the 2021 PLC Careers Fair will be run virtually. \n\nThe details are as follows:\nDate: Thursday, 8 April 2021 \nTime: 12:00 to 3:00 PM\nURL:  Coming soon!  \n\nA Virtual Careers Fair works like a face-to-face fair except that \u2018booths\u2019 are replaced with unique Zoom video rooms for each sponsor to interact with and meet students. We\u2019ll be running the Virtual Careers Fair with the support of GradAustralia and technology partner, Prosple. \n\nThe Zoom video booths are not one-on-one meetings with students, rather anywhere between a few students and 100 students. All participants in an exhibitor\u2019s unique video room will also be able to hear or see the question, as well as the answer from the exhibitor.\n\nStudents will have their audio and video muted by default. They have the flexibility to turn either on if the sponsor firm advises that it is appropriate to do so.\n\nThis event is open to all students from all years, and you'll get to talk to firm representatives about clerkship, graduate and pre-penultimate programs - so lock the date in your calendar and keep your eyes peeled for more information coming down the track!\n\nRegister here: https://forms.gle/1UvVmpqvjHqJZsYj8\n\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Madison Wu at madison.wu@unswlawsoc.org or Rory Dolan at rory.dolan@unswlawsoc.org",

Steve will be sharing incredibly helpful advice on principled negotiation, how to best perform in internal mediation and negotiation competitions, and how to transfer these skills to external competitions. Steve is keen to meet students eager to compete nationally and internationally so attendance is especially encouraged for those looking to compete externally. \n\nThe first masterclass will take place from 6:15pm-8pm on Monday 12 April and the second will be from 6:15pm-8pm on Thursday 22 April (room numbers TBD). Both masterclasses will be occurring in-person and streamed on Zoom, however, only students who attend or watch the sessions will receive Steve\u2019s written materials. As Steve will conduct interactive sessions, we encourage in-person attendance to get the most out of the events.  \n\nPlease email Bridget Hudson at skills@unswlawsoc.org if you have any questions.

The perfect labour force, robots are not born but instead are meticulously crafted out of flesh and blood by the handful of engineers and scientists that work in the factory. Rossum\u2019s robots are state of the art, they can think for themselves and solve problems but do not feel, do not love and do not question orders, at least at first. When Robot Rights activist Helena visits the factory and becomes entangled in the lives of the scientists, things begin to happen with the robots and the line between master and worker is turned on its head.\n\nAs the metal boots come crashing down and humanity is coming to an end, the burning question remains, what is it that really makes us human? R.U.R, the gripping sci-fi play that first coined the term Robot, remains funny, clever and more poignant than ever for a modern audience.\n\nTICKETS: https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/nuts-presents-rossums-universal-robots-tickets-147917853281\n\nCAST\nCinnamon Howearth, Josh Hammond, Noah Cohen Stoddart, Emily Brennan, Tom Layton, Rory Coverdale, Nye Morrison, Zoe Berg, Bonnie Vance, Miguel Jones Diaz\n\nCREW\nDirector: Angus Crampton\nAssistant Director: Diego Garcia\nProducer: Rachael Adamson\nLead Designer: Jade Gillis\nScript Consultant & Sound Designer: Martin Gallagher\nStage Manager: Aarya Nair\nLighting Designer: Jerri Kim\nAssistant Lighting Designer: Yingying Zhang\nCo-Set Designer: Anaya Vora\nCo-Set Designer & Props Master: Emma To\nChoreographer & Movement Consultant: Alex Gonzalez\nPublicity Head: Rosie Lambert\nGraphic Designer: Indi Sofyar\nPhotographer: Matthew Miceli\nMakeup Artist: Sarah Kavka\n\nRunning time: approx. 1 1/2 hours\nContent Warning: strobe lighting, guns",

    "description": "Hey Runners!\nIt's time to get excited about RunSoc Camp 2021! This year we once again hope to bring you an unforgettable experience trail running the Blue Mountains. It's beginner friendly, and much like the structure of RunSoc Fridays, there will be different pace groups to cater to most abilities. When we're not running, which is about half the day, we'll be playing board games, socialising and just generally having a good time. We ask you to keep in mind that trail running is quite different to road-running because you must be attentive at all times to prevent tripping. A hydration pack will be compulsory as there will not be water along the routes. That being said, we will be having a hiking options during the camp to give your legs some rest! More details to come!\n\nFor those of you who have been to camp before, this camp is tad dearer than previous camps because we've had more sign-ups than in previous years and have had to move to a larger site. It's more spacious and has more recreational facilities such as a courtyard, more indoor break-out areas, a basketball court, a table tennis table, and apparently, an entire OVAL. It also has easier parking! (which I'm sure Annica and her van will appreciate)\n\nWhen: Friday 28 May to Sunday 30 May, during the T1-T2 holidays. \nAccommodation: Katoomba Christian Convention (KCC) - Kedumba\nCost for FULL STAY: $145 for ARC members, $160 for non-ARC members. ($5 discount if you purchased merch in the most recent merch run for both ARC and non-ARC members)\nCost for TWO DAYS ONLY: $75 for ARC members, $85 for non-ARC members. (No discounts)\n\nPayment details:\nBSB: 062 303\nACCT #: 1109 9750\nACCT Name: UNSW CAMPUS RUNNERS\nMessage: CAMP + FULL NAME\n\nRegistration closes: 11.59pm Friday 14 May, 2021.",
