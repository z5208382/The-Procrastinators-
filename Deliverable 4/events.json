In Myanmar, workers and students are leading a revolution for democracy, and Black lives matter in 2020 saw 26 million people protest in America, which spread to Australia and other countries. As was the case from the 1930s to the 60s and 70s, crises and radicalisation has never been limited to one country, but international. Australia isn't an exception. Marxists argue that international revolution is not just necessary, but totally possible because the class-divided, unequal and oppressive system of capitalism is global. \n\nThis Thursday, come to UNSW Socialist Alternative's forum to discuss why revolution is possible in Australia. \n\nFor more info, contact Josh on 0408 885 622.\nredflag.org.au",

    "description": "COVID can't keep a good play down! \n\nThis production unfortunately had to be cancelled a few weeks out from show-week last year due to the onset of the pandemic, but we're very excited to announce it's return! \n\n\nSynopsis:\nOn his 30th birthday, investment banker Joseph K is \u2018arrested\u2019 for seemingly no reason and without any immediately visible consequences. As K grapples with the subtle and strange ways this event impacts his life, he struggles to deal with pressure from his co-workers, concern from his family and an infuriating yet hilarious unhelpfulness from anyone he turns to for help. When his case eventually consumes his whole life, K succumbs to paranoia and burns all his bridges in a climactic, surreal confrontation.\n\nA retelling of Franz Kafka\u2019s classic novel \"The Trial\" set in modern-day London, this play deals with themes of bureaucracy, surveillance and individual freedoms through increasingly dark comedy and satire.\n\nPlease note only certain roles are being re-auditioned, refer to the audition pack for more details.\n\nContent Warnings: depictions of death, use of prop guns, flashing lights\n\n\nProduction Team:\nDirector: Jordan Barnes\nProducer: Jade Gillis\nLead Designer: Louisa Fitzgerald\nAssistant Director: Diego Garcia\n\n\nAudition Times and Locations (10-minute individual auditions):\n- Tuesday 27th April 6:30pm-9:30pm (Location: TBA, UNSW)\n- Saturday 1st May 12pm-3pm (Location: TBA, UNSW)\n\n\nImportant Dates:\n- Rehearsals: Saturdays 11am-4pm, with Wednesday 6:30-9pm being added closer to show week\n* Show Week: Sunday 1st August (Bump-in) - Saturday 7th August (Closing Night/Bump-out)\n* Show Dates: Tuesday 3rd August-Saturday 7th August\n\n\nThe Audition:\nAuditions will involve reads of sides given in the audition pack, along with brief workshopping with the director. You do not need to memorise the sides but please familiarise yourself with the side for the character you\u2019re auditioning for. The team may ask you to cold-read for another character.\n\n\nAudition Pack (please read!):\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/126huqd5VcML99khPSE0j-XNLTeOLDC6i8r2qyIxpS4Y/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\nBook Your Audition:\nnutsjosephk.simplybook.me/v2/\n\n\nIf you have any questions about your audition, or you can\u2019t make any of the audition times, please email josephk@nuts.org.au\n\n\nThis is an amateur production by arrangement with Nick Hern Books",

Now we\u2019re going mega, inviting one of Australia\u2019s most beloved party starters to the UNSW Roundhouse for a day of pure disco elation. Picnic is chuffed to bring you\u2026\n\nCC:DISCO!\n\nCourtney from the country, now the Antipodean queen of disco, CC has exploded in the past few years simply through playing unbelievable set after unbelievable set all over the planet. Having presented on radio and honed her craft since she was 15, her weekly PBS FM slot of six years \u2018Smoke and Mirrors\u2019 became a local institution\u2014the quintessential Friday night party starter\u2014priming her for a bi-weekly residency on Rinse FM, where she\u2019s broadcast her message of love and good times to ears on every continent. She\u2019s become one of Melbourne\u2019s biggest international exports, playing heaps of the world\u2019s best festivals like Glastonbury, Love International and Kala, but even after moving to Lisbon her roots are still firmly back home in Aus. Her First Light compilation repped a stack of amazing local artists. Now it\u2019s time for a second installment and this time CC has selected 24 eclectic local and international acts. First Light Volume 2 is due out on May 7 and features everything from Balearic shakers to hard ass Italo, home listening groovers to 4am bangers.\n\nBasically, everywhere she goes, every set she plays, CC instantly gains lifelong fans because her music is so ridiculously good and her vibe is so irresistibly positive. So what could be more of a positive vibe than a Picnic day out at the Roundhouse with CC:DISCO? Not much. Except with the added bonus that local legends Mike Who and Adi Toohey will be getting the party started right.",

Their long-awaited return is the band\u2019s first Australian shows in 7 years.\n\nThe band\u2019s tour history reads like a textbook of subcultural mile markers in the modern heavy music scene. An initial hardscrabble headlining outing in 2009 has been followed by multiple mainstage runs on the Vans Warped Tour; tours with Slash, Motley Crue, Avenged Sevenfold, Bullet For My Valentine; the massive Resurrection Tour, co-headlined by new labelmates Asking Alexandria; multiple US festivals, including Rock on the Range and Aftershock; and several appearances at the UK\u2019s acclaimed Download Festival.\n\nBe sure to pick up your ticket for one of the hottest tours of the year.\n\nBlack Veil Brides \nhttp://www.blackveilbrides.net/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Blackveilbrides/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/blackveilbrides/\nhttps://twitter.com/blackveilbrides\n\nListen/Watch  \ud83c\udfa7 \nSpotify\nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/6O7MpKrY91vlCd4Osi6XKs?si=cF06XhaFT3ulAMewsdpVcw\nYouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/BlackVeilBridestv\n\nVideos\n'In The End'\nhttps://youtu.be/f0EQlIzPowM\n'Knives and Pens'\nhttps://youtu.be/gFDCHdKbKBY\n'Fallen Angel'\nhttps://youtu.be/VuGzJVKtW6g\n'The Legacy'\nhttps://youtu.be/OsO9wGRf5hI\n'Goodbye Agony' \nhttps://youtu.be/f-cxPIOAfSk\n'Rebel Love Song'\nhttps://youtu.be/Rl-_ZmNCOvo",

    "description": "Hey Runners!\nIt's time to get excited about RunSoc Camp 2021! This year we once again hope to bring you an unforgettable experience trail running the Blue Mountains. It's beginner friendly, and much like the structure of RunSoc Fridays, there will be different pace groups to cater to most abilities. When we're not running, which is about half the day, we'll be playing board games, socialising and just generally having a good time. We ask you to keep in mind that trail running is quite different to road-running because you must be attentive at all times to prevent tripping. A hydration pack will be compulsory as there will not be water along the routes. That being said, we will be having a hiking options during the camp to give your legs some rest! More details to come!\n\nFor those of you who have been to camp before, this camp is tad dearer than previous camps because we've had more sign-ups than in previous years and have had to move to a larger site. It's more spacious and has more recreational facilities such as a courtyard, more indoor break-out areas, a basketball court, a table tennis table, and apparently, an entire OVAL. It also has easier parking! (which I'm sure Annica and her van will appreciate)\n\nWhen: Friday 28 May to Sunday 30 May, during the T1-T2 holidays. \nAccommodation: Katoomba Christian Convention (KCC) - Kedumba\nCost for FULL STAY: $145 for ARC members, $160 for non-ARC members. ($5 discount if you purchased merch in the most recent merch run for both ARC and non-ARC members)\nCost for TWO DAYS ONLY: $75 for ARC members, $85 for non-ARC members. (No discounts)\n\nPayment details:\nBSB: 062 303\nACCT #: 1109 9750\nACCT Name: UNSW CAMPUS RUNNERS\nMessage: CAMP + FULL NAME\n\nRegistration closes: 11.59pm Friday 14 May, 2021.",
